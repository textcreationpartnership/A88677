         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BY vertue of two Commiſſions dated at <hi>Hague,</hi> 5. <hi>June</hi> 1649. directed to us from our dread Soveraigne Lord, <hi>CHARLES,</hi> of that name the SECOND, by the grace of GOD, <hi>KING</hi> of <hi>England, Scotland, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Defendor of the Faith: Whereby we were injoyned to make our ſpeedy repaire to the <hi>Iſle of Man,</hi> and there to give our beſt aſſiſtance both in Counſel and Perſonall Service, to the Right Honourable, JAMES, Earle of <hi>Darby,</hi> the true and noble Lord thereof, in keeping of that Iſland for His MAJESTIES ſervice, wherein was ſweetly and conſequently involved, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the true Proteſtant Religion, in ſubſtance and forme as it was profeſſed in the daies of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, Princes of bleſſed and glorious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; the eſtabliſhing His Majeſty in His Thrones, inveſted with His juſt Power and Greatneſſe, from which He is moſt injuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and trayterouſly kept; the reſtoring Parliaments to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Priviledges, which are moſt violently broken; the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the fundamentall Lawes moſt ſtrangely violated, and redeeming the people, now moſt barbarouſly vaſſalaged, to their antient Freedome; and laſtly, the bringing to juſtice the Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the KING His Father, which horrid and ſalvage act, we proteſt before God and the whole world, we abhorre from our ſoules, and tremble to heare of: In obedience to which high Command, and at the ſerious perſwaſions of our judgments and conſciences, with all convenient ſpeed, we made our repaire to the <hi>Iſle of Man.</hi> Where we found the Right Honourable, the

               <!-- PDF PAGE 125 -->Earle of <hi>Darby</hi> (who gave us very reſpective and cheerfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment) and whoſe fidelity, and loyalty, we muſt ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and admire; conteſting and ſtrugling with the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous temptations &amp; importunate ſolicitations of one <hi>Henry Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who pretends himſelfe to be Commiſſary Generall to that Army under the Command of <hi>Thomas,</hi> Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> to whom, in the name of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> as he is pleaſed to call that <hi>Juncto</hi> at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> he required this Iſland to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and for his Lordſhips encouragement therein, he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed an Act of Indempnity for what he had formerly acted, in relation to His late Majeſties ſervice, and to be repoſſeſſed of his whole Eſtate without Compoſition: In aſſurance of his Lordſhips ſcorne and <hi>odium</hi> whereof, his Lordſhip was pleaſed to ſhew us the Copie of a Letter, which two daies before our arrivall, he had return'd by <hi>Ireton's</hi> Meſſenger for their finall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: which Letter, (the teſtimony of his honour and loyalty) we read over with very much alacrity: and adviſed his Lordſhip to print it together with a Declaration, for ſatisfaction of His Majeſty and His three Kingdomes; and to cleare his honour of that blemiſh, with which ſome malecontented perſons might poſſibly endeavour to ſtaine it.</p>
            <p>In purſuit of which counſell, his Lordſhip was pleaſed forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to draw up a Declaration, which, together with the fore-mentioned Letter, was ſpeedily diſpatched to <hi>London</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Preſſe, where, as appeares by ſome of them, that have ſince come to our hands, it was printed without the leaſt adulteration; and, whereas to our griefe we have ſince heard, that there are ſome that have not been wanting, with very much confidence to report, that it was a meer fiction, contriv'd by ſome <hi>Mercury,</hi> to delude the people, and was no whit the ſence of the Earl of <hi>Darby:</hi> To which we here declare, that we verily believe, that report to be framed in the <hi>Juncto,</hi> or by ſome of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, to deceive the people, (whom his Lordſhip was preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to delude) that ſo they might encourage their Abettors, and diſcourage His Majeſties loyall Subjects from repairing hither to our aſſiſtance: And though it is very probable, that our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will by the ſame device endeavour to darken the credit of this our preſent Declaration, yet they ſhall aſſuredly find the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:154024:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 125 -->contents of both fulfilled in our faithfull keeping this Iſland for His Majeſties beſt advantage, and their worſt offence; and we hope, that though our Enemies doe find encouragement in their misbeliefe hereof, yet our loyal-hearted Friends will be no waies over-ſwayed by doubt or the credit of their report, but will with ſpeed &amp; chearfulneſs repaire hither to an unanimous conjunction with us, where they ſhal find ſuch incouragement as his Lordſhip promiſed, and with magnanimity and honour we will reſolutely unite our daring Spirits to the finall overthrow of the Rebels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and their tyrannicall power both by Sea and Land.</p>
            <p>And now we cannot but expreſſe, with how deep a ſence of our Native Countries miſeries our ſoules are affected, nor can we but lament the condition of poſterity, whoſe Fathers have ſhamefully forfeited the antient and glorious Liberty which was purchaſed by their Fore-fathers; and left them bound in the fetters of a moſt miſerable bondage: nor can we believe but that many of thoſe men, who were, in the beginning of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Diviſions between KING and Parliament, carried away from their Loyalty by an overmuch credulity to their faire and plauſible pretences, have been long ſince ſenſible that it was their owne ambitious ends they then proſecuted, and not the welfare of the now miſerable Kingdome; nor can we but admire, nor could we have believed, (had we not been the fad Witneſſes thereof) that any men could be ſo ſtrangely impudent, as to act ſo flat contrary to all their Oathes, Covenants, Vowes, Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Declarations, to continue the Government of the Kingdome, and the juſt Power and Prerogative of the KING and His Poſterity, in the perfect fulneſſe of their due glory and ſplendour; and yet notwithſtanding all this, overthrow the very foundation of Government, decapitate the KING, and caſhiere His Poſterity; and with ſalvage barbarity declare and proclaime [that it ſhall be lawfuull for any Man to ſurprize and kill our preſent dread-Soveraigne the KING, and His Princely Brother the DUKE of <hi>Yorke,</hi> as Traytours and Spies, wherever they ſhall meet them within the limits of theſe Kingdomes] ſuch a piece of Treaſon, as we are confident, the moſt horrid, monſtrous, and execrable Traytours that ever trod upon the face of the Earth would have bluſhed to have owned; nor is this all, but even in

            <p>And now we doe declare, that in the beginning of unhappy differences being fully ſatisfied of the juſtneſſe of His late Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties cauſe, in our judgements and conſcience, according to our duty and allegiance we tooke up Armes on His Majeſties Party, where we continu'd faithfully, acting to the utmoſt of our power what ever might make for His Majeſties advantage, and have ſince manifeſted our unſtained Loyalty in our patient ſufferings, not having neglected any thing even in our moſt clouded condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which might renew His Majeſties intereſt in the Field: and we doe proteſt in the preſence of Almighty God, that we ſhall alwaies uſe the ſame fidelity and induſtry in the truſt repoſed in us by our preſent dread Soveraigne, holding our ſelves bound in the ſame bonds of fealty to His Majeſty that we were to the late King His Father, of ever bleſſed yet bleeding memory; nor ſhall we lay down Armes, but by Gods aſſiſtance faithfully and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely purſue His Majeſties Enemies, till we have reduced all that are in Rebellion to their due obedience, brought the Murderers of His late Majeſty to ſpeedy &amp; impartiall juſtice, and abſolutely deſtroyed their intereſt both by Land and Sea: nor can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine but that all honeſt men who have any ſence of His Majeſties ſufferings, their owne loyalty, and their Countries miſery, will chearfully give their aſſiſtance both in purſe and perſon, in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this pious &amp; honorable Ingagement, wherein is ſo deeply concerned maintenance of the true Proteſtant Religion, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of His Majeſties Royall Perſon from murder, together with His juſt Rights and Prerogatives, the Priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Law of the Land, the Liberty of the Subject, and the ſuppreſſion of Rebellion; not queſtioning but that God will at length owne his owne cauſe, and remove all thoſe clouds which have hitherto darkned the ſplendor thereof, that ſo its true luſter may plainly &amp; fully appear to the eye of every mans judgement, to his own glory, His Majeſties honor, &amp; the good of the people.</p>
